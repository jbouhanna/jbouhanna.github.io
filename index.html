                          **Armenian Identity Through Music**

Overview
==============================================================

From 1915 to 1923, the Armenian Genocide was the ethnic cleansing, cultural erasure, and expulsion of Armenians from their indigenous lands. This blog post describes, analyzes, and demonstrates how the Armenian diaspora around the world preserves its cultural identity through Armenian popular music. Through the use of written, aural, and visual resources, I will exhibit how the development of Armenian popular music since the 20th century functions as a connection to the homeland. First, an analysis of the works of 20th century Armenian composer and ethnomusicologist Gomidas will exemplify the marriage of the Western and Armenian music systems, as well as the composition, research, and preservation of Armenian music. This is followed by an examination of Armenian popular music in various places around the world, such as Armenia, Lebanon, and the coastal United States. These examinations will explore how the mixing and influence of Armenian music with the musical styles of different regions contribute to the Armenian identity. In order to establish a foundation which both Armenian music and identity have evolved from, these discussions will be supplemented by synopses on the Armenian music system, common Armenian instruments, and major events throughout Armenian history. 


I will be using the Western Armenian dialect for translations as I see fit.

Background
============================================================== 
<p class='bigger'> **Armenian Identity** </p>

What is Armenian Identity? Surely a specific answer exists, but I would argue that a specific answer is a wrong answer. I would believe that for any culture, what gives something a cultural identity isn't something as rigid as the composer being related to said culture, or being created in a specific place. I agree with the argument brought up by Tchilingirian, where it is the intent, thought, and message behind a cultural creation that establishes that connection <a href="#Tchilingirian"> [1].</a> This allows it to be flexible should it change over time, and allows for those who feel disconnected to their culture to become a part of it.


<p class='bigger'> **Armenian Music System** </p>

<p><img src="musicalmodes.png" style="float:right;width:405px;height:250px;"></p>
Early Armenian chant music adhered to an 8-mode system known as *octoechos* (Armenian: ութ ձայն / oot tsayn - "eight voices") <a href="#Kerovpyan"> [2] </a>. This system has two different practices: liturgical and musical. The liturgical practice has the 8 modes evenly split into voice modes (first voice, second voice, etc.) and side modes (first side, second side, etc.). These divisions can be compared to the authentic and plagal divisions of Gregorian chant. The musical modes are also split up as such, but also has 4 further subdivisions: main mode, secondary modes, deviations, and ramifications. 

These subdivisions exist due to a specific subset of liturgical music known as *sharagan*, which made use of a tetrachordal system with non-Western intervals. Some of these intermediate intervals are major and minor semitones, subminor thirds, medium thirds, and pure major thirds. Taking some combination of three of these intervals forms a tetrachord species that fits into one of the octoechos subdivisions. For further details, especially with regard to the connection to the liturgical year, please check out the <a href="#Kerovpyan"> video by the Kerovpyans referenced in the bibliography. </a>

<p class='bigger'> **Traditional Instruments** </p>

Gomidas Vartabed
================

<p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 30px; float: right; display: block;"><img src="Gomidas.jpg" width="300" height="400" /><br /><span>Gomidas at work <br /> http://www.komitas.am/eng/gallery/photos/photos1.htm</span></p>

On October 8, 1869, Soghomon Soghomanian was born in Keotayha in the Ottoman Empire. From an early age, he received extensive religious education and was eventually ordained as a priest known as a *vartabed*. He then took on the pseudonym "Gomidas" after the 7th-century Armenian poet Gomidas Aghtsetsi, and became commonly known as Gomidas Vartabed<a href="#Vagramian"> [4].</a> 

Composing, arranging, and transcribing over 3,000 works of folk music, Gomidas's works received praise from local communities and abroad. Later in his musical career, Gomidas had received a three-year scholarship to study music in Berlin. He accepted it and went on to study music history, including the works of Beethoven and Mozart. In addition, he visited many of the symphonic and choral concerts, as well as operas. It was here that Gomidas established the marriage between western music and Armenian music. His studies in the Caucasus and Europe helped bring his Eastern influences (such as instruments) to the West, and Western influences (such as the notation system) to the East. He continued to compose and arrange while in Berlin, while also entertaining professional journals with his insight on eastern music. These insights were not only on the origins and meanings behind Armenian music, but also the Arabic, Kurdish, Turkish, and Persian melodies that he studied as part of his ethnomusicological career.

Gomidas later ended up at the Paris Conservatory, where he brought his Armenian influnces and phonetics to the interested French singers. Successfully coaching these students into renowned concert performances, he was often compared to Bartok, and Debussy himself remarked that even if "Andouni" ("Homeless") was the only song ever composed by Gomidas, he should still be considered as one of the musical greats <a href="#Tchilingirian"> [5]. </a>

What is so special about "Andouni"? Let's take a look! Give a listen to this performance by Isabel Bayrakdarian (English translation included in the video). 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VSjRy0sKk8Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Below is part of the score for the piece, <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Collected_Works_(Vardapet%2C_Komitas)">taken from IMSLP.</a> This segment is the very beginning:

<p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 30px; display: block;"><img src="andouni1.png" width="600" height="400" /><br /><span></span></p>

We see (and hear) how the melody doesn't really move up or down. The rhythm varies, but for the most part the opening of the piece likes to sit on E (the dominant, since we are in A minor). It then moves to the key of D, establishing a sense of "home". We return to A minor afterwards.

Now, the following section:

<p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 30px; display: block;"><img src="andouni2.png" width="600" height="400" /><br /><span></span></p>

We still have a melody centered around E5, but also a little more D5 - the mind is trying to move on. More chromaticism is thrown in which discombobulates what "home" really feels like. Later on, we feel the tempo speed up and slow back down over the span of a couple measures, and the melody dies out at its end. The piece as a whole repeats this kind of structure - establish a connection to A minor, moving "home" to D, and then shaking that sense of home before returning back to a concrete feeling. It gives this sense of homelessness - the melody is wandering between keys, trying to find one where it feels that it belongs to.

Finally: 

<p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 30px; display: block;"><img src="andouni3.png" width="600" height="400" /><br /><span></span></p>

The song reaches its conclusion here, dying and fading away into nothingness. The final words, "O you poor child without a home" slowly decays as the song returns to A minor, the key that started it all. Again, the main melody continues to sit on E, but now at a lower octave. We have sank far below, but still struggle to move on. 

Overall, the lyrics generalize the despair and helplessness felt by Armenians in an artistic fashion. The end of each stanza has drawn-out notes, sighs, and tense  exclamations that draws emotional appeal and contributes to the dramatic intensity. The slow tempo gives this sense of a motionless state - life goes on, but the soul is trapped in an inner struggle. There is a lot of vocal emptiness between lines, giving the idea the mind is slow to think as it wallows in misery. There is no comfort left in the world, so "let me be food for the fish" instead. 

It is important to note Gomidas arranged "Andouni" before the 1915 events. However, his mastery of music enabled the song to resonate the somber and despair that the victims have felt, futureproofing the use of it.

In my opinion, Gomidas is *the* Armenian music icon. His work cannot be overstated, and I encourage you to read more about him at http://www.komitas.am/eng/index_eng.php


Armenia
================

Gomidas covers most, if not all, of Armenian music during the Ottoman Empire. We will now jump ahead a couple years to the Armenian SSR. 

<p class='bigger'> **Soviet Armenia** </p>

Political and societal expression was heavily suppressed under Soviet rule. However, the emergence of folk ensembles was highly encouraged in order to generate trust from the dozens of ethnic groups residing in the USSR <a href="#Nercessian">[6]</a>. However, under the policy of *korenizatsiya* (indigenization), all cultural aspects had to adhere to the Soviet standard. In addition, Russian eventually became mandatory to learn, which attempted to wipe out lingual differences.

<p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 30px; float: right; display: block;"><img src="ensemble.jpg" width="300" height="400" /><br /><span>Modern Aram Merangulian Ensemble<br /> https://en.armradio.am/2015/07/02/</span></p>

For folk music, this meant that composers and performers had to learn classical techniques, and raise folk music to the "level" of classical music. For the Armenian ensembles, this meant taking the duduk and reconstructing it with Western techniques in mind. The duduk became standardized in three different registers, which reintroduced it as a more "serious" instrument <a href="#Nercessian">[7]</a>. The musicians had to become fluent in Western notation, and learn to play with "Western instruments" in the ensemble. "Western instruments" because the instrumentation was a classical to folk translation rather than one-to-one: duduks had to play with *knars* and *davoughs* (type of lyre and harp, respectively), essentially building a mock orchestra with folk instruments. In addition to becoming accustomed to a conductor, musicians also had to get used to the idea of parts and part assignments. Needless to say, Armenian musicians felt very out of place, but had to conform to these new ideas. Armenian music is typically monophonic, but now their tunes were harmonized, split into parts, and standardized.

However, the fact remains that Armenian music was still unique and identifiable. The first Armenian folk ensemble - the Aram Merangulian ensemble - went on tours outside of the USSR. This was allowed because Armenian nationalism was not deemed as a threat, as it was mainly directed at the perpetrators of the genocide rather than at the USSR. This gave the ensemble a chance to show the world that they are not just some sovietized people - they are Armenians with their own music, culture, and traditions. Arsen Grigorian, a member of the ensemble, expressed that folk music is pure. There is no nationality tied to classical music, but folk music was *theirs*. It was Armenian, and could not be "corrupted by foreign elements" <a href="#Nercessian">[8]</a>. The important idea is that despite Soviet oppression of cultural elements, Armenians were still able to express and connect to their culture and home due to the immaculate aspects of folk music. Even after the dissolution of the USSR, these folk ensembles continued to exist and perform around the world, spreading musical and cultural exchanges and firmly cementing that the Armenian identity is here to stay.


<p class='bigger'> **Modern Armenia** </p>

After the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, Armenia re-adopted it's national anthem: "Մեր Հայրենիք" ("Mer Hayrenik" - Our Fatherland). It was originally adopted in 1918, but was short-lived as Armenia was annexed by the USSR in the early 1920s. The anthem was composed by Parsegh Ganatchian, a spiritual child to Gomidas. Ganatchian is a Lebanese-Armenian composer who found inspiration from the diatonic, tetrachordal music that was commonly found in hymns and Gomidas' music. The lyrics were written by Mikayel Nalbandian, and together the music and words give off a sense of pride and love for Armenia. Below is my melodic transcription of the piece. Note the prevalence of tetrachords, as well as the melodic line built around F major. The melody builds upwards before each cadence, and relaxes down to F major euphony, indicating a hopeful and spirited future for Armenia.

<p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 30px; display: block;"><img src="Hayrenik.png" width="850" height="100" /><br /> <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJlV2myxkys">Music and lyrics (translated)</a> </span></p> 

Many were excited to return to life as they remembered and enjoy a free Armenia. With the new technology of music videos, many popular singers took the opportunity to use music videos to emphasize disruption and to restore national identity <a href="#Adriaans">[9]</a>. One such example of disruption is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaI6S8325E"> Nersik Ispiryan's "Hrant Dink"</a>, a music video dedicated to the Turkish-Armenian journalist who was assassinated in 2007. Accompanied by a melancholic duduk, Ispiryan sings of the anger he feels when the innocent are murdered and how justice may never be served because of those that continue to deny the truth. He connects with the anger Armenians have regarding genocide denial, and uses music to communicate to the world how injustice still roams free in the Caucasus.

A music video focused on national identity and culture is Ruben Sasunci's "Sasna Par", meaning "Dance from Sasun". This song serves as a cultural revitalization of regions (namely, Sasun) that have been destroyed by the genocide. In particular, the music video features Armenians in folkloric costumes performing the warrior dances of Sasun <a href="#Adriaans">[10]</a>. It shows the story of a man reaching out to the older generation folks, who try to teach him the dance. Confused at first, the man learns the dance, earns confidence, and shows off his moves with pride. It also prominently features the zurna, which contributes to the dance feeling of the song. The video has an educational aspect because of all this, and also demonstrates the spirit and life behind the dance. It is not just a dance - it is an emblem of identity. Even though the lands were cleansed, the memories and spirit behind it still live on today.

Lebanon
================

A local haven for genocide survivors, Lebanon became known as the de facto capital of the Armenian diaspora due to welcoming a large influx of refugees <a href="#Alajaji2">[11]</a>. Here, Armenians worked to rebuild their lives and stay connected with each other. One way to do this was through music, of course. After facing near annihilation, one critical matter to the diaspora was the notion of language. The scattering of Armenians around the world, as well as lack of Armenian education in these various places, have caused the Armenian language to become forgotten in bits and pieces to many families. Many Armenians were familiar with the Turkish and Arabic languages due to living in the Ottoman Empire and nearby Arab countries, which lessened the use of Armenian. 

<p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 30px; float: right; display: block;"><img src="adiss.jpg" width="320" height="400" /><br /><span>Adiss Harmandian <br /> Album cover, *Live At The Gulbenkian Theatre* </span></p>

Slowly but surely, the diaspora caught on to this and began pushing for more use of the Armenian language. For example, church bulletins and graffiti appeared in Armenian neighborhoods insisting that Armenian be spoken <a href="#Alajaji2">[12]</a>. Church hymns were sung in Armenian, and many composed songs by Armenians had lyrics purely in Armenian. Hymns written in other languages were converted to Armenian, both in writing and singing. The Lebanese-Armenian community is unique in that in a region outside of Armenia, the Armenian language flourished and revitalized. Language was seen as the key cultural marker of Armenian identity, and the diaspora in Lebanon adopted the idea of "to be Armenian, you must speak Armenian." 

A large inspiration to the lingual push in church music was Gomidas himself. Although he spent his final years in Paris, he left behind a mantle that would be taken up by Armenian choirs. The choirs sang, harmonized, and taught his songs to schools and orphanages all throughout Lebanon. These choirs would tour the Middle East and Europe, similarly to how Gomidas' choirs did. The content of this music helped strengthen the idea of "Armenianness". They would sing of the Armenian mountain Ararat, historical events, and important heroes in Armenian history. The performances of choirs worked three-fold: revitalize the Armenian language, teach the listeners of important aspects of Armenian heritage and history, and tie the once-broken community together. The immense popularity of these choirs caused them to become the musical focal point for Armenians in Lebanon <a href="#Alajaji2">[13]</a>.

One notable Lebanese-Armenian star was Adiss Harmandian, who was active from the 1960s to the early 2000s. He is considered a pioneer of the hybrid genre known as *estradayin*, and earned popularity both at home and abroad. His success overseas was tied to touring far away lands such as the United States (which was a big deal back in 1960!). His big hit was Ծաղիկներ ("Dzaghigner" - flowers), and was mainly due to the Armenian community craving for a lighthearted song <a href="#Apelian">[14]</a>. Other differences from the norm, such as using a flute rather than a duduk and a drumset rather than a dhol, help the song standout in uniqueness and give it a "foreign" feel (remember we are in Lebanon, so there was no forced Westernization of music like there was in the USSR). This taps in to the idea that many of the Armenian listeners feel foreign and far from home, while the melody and lyrics help them reminisce.

Ես շատ արտասուեցի
Բայց աւաղ ճար չկար։

Ծաղիկնե՜ր, ծաղիկներ,…

Ես լուռ փնտռում եմ քեզ,
Փնտռում տենչում եմ քեզ,

    <h2>English Translation</h2>
    <p>Sevan is rippling,
Sevan is calling,
In the waves of the sea,
Sevan is smiling.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Flowers, flowers,
Eternal flowers,
You need love,
Witnesses who will never forget.

Flowers, flowers,
Eternal flowers,
Flowers that dream,
Flowers of my love.

<br />
Our love was a dream,
I woke up and it was gone,
I cried a lot
But alas, there was no remedy.

Flowers, flowers,…

I'm quietly searching for you,
Searching yearning for you,
Forgive me my love,
For that I still love you…</p>
  </div>
</div>

Adiss sings of eternal flowers that grew by Lake Sevan in Armenia, which is a metaphor for the Armenian land and the people that lived in it. The flowers are eternal, but it is only a dream that they are still together. There is emotional pain involved, and the lake and flowers are separated. However, the lake will continue to look for the flowers, as their love is strong and will help them reunite. 

Personally, this song reminds me of the Armenian expression Մենք ենք մեր լեռները (We are our mountains). Throughout Armenian history, the mountains have served as protection for the Armenians and Armenians built their civilizations around them. Now separated from the mountains, Armenians continue to look after each other and protect each other. The mountains are still there to love, but now the people have become their own mountains by loving and caring for one another.

Popular follow-up songs kept this lighthearted/relaxed vibe, such as the love song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y91nWOefnyM"> "Ayl Acher Gan Im Srdoum" (There Are Other Eyes In My Heart)</a>. For Armenians at the time, home took on three different dimensions. There is the past home of the Ottoman Empire, the current home of Lebanon, and the spiritual home of Armenia <a href="#Alajaji1">[15]</a>. Adiss' music allowed for a connection to home that wasn't fueled by hate, but rather sorrow and melancholy.

United States - New York
================

<p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 30px; float: right; display: block;"><img src="maid.jpg" width="240" height="300" /><br /><span>Armenian Maid, a 1919 song that fundraised Armenian relief <br /> https://arabkitsch.com/song-directory-2/239/armenian-maid/ </span></p>

New York - the jazz capital of America. Jazz has popularly fused with many other genres, and this includes Armenian music. Armenians contributed a lot to the music scene on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan by performing in the nightclubs and restaurants. This attracted not only Armenians, but also the variety of other people in the area. Popular performers included Mary Vartanian, Marko Melkon, and Garbis Bakirgian (who later moved to California) <a href="#Alajaji2">[16].</a> Music served as a way to share culture and to raise awareness regarding the on-going genocide. 

Most notably, the quartet known as Night Ark helped spotlight Armenian music in the jazz world. Featuring the oud, piano, percussion, and bass, Night Ark mixed Armenian music with jazz, classical, pop, and rock music to create a blend of jazz with an eastern feel <a href="#Kassabian">[17].</a>

One of their most popular pieces is "Homecoming" from *Picture*, which is an instrumental track that makes use of both eastern and western musical elements. The prominence of an oud playing on top of a tresillo pattern on a marimba all while a hi-hat emphasizes the offbeats pulls the ear to a stylistic contrast that works together in harmony. Note the density of embellished notes and "fast" subdivisions, which is another common flair of Caucasus music. Even with the rhythmic complexity, the tresillo pattern continues throughout to establish a firm pulse.

<iframe width="200" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oY86vYX_q8A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Other songs such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU5F5xS1lCg"> "They Love Me 15 Feet Away"</a> incorporates vocals, and has a more upbeat tempo and rhythm, giving off a pop feel to the music. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2ikBp1OLfc"> "Very Nice"</a> is more of a smooth jazz piece, and is mainly a duet between the oud and piano.

As a diaspora, Armenians struggle with establishing their presence, political recognition, intermarriage, and declining growth in fluent speakers. Armenians sometimes feel very nationalistic to fight against this mixing and loss of culture, as seen in the Lebanon section. Especially with regards to music, there is an overlap between Armenian and Turkish music, which makes classification of Armenian music to be a controversial topic for some Armenians <a href="#Safi">[18]</a>. However, Armenian fusion groups such as Night Ark twist that negative idea into a positive - "they use diasporan  culture  to  reflect  and  support,  produce  and  project  their  mixed  identities in thoughtful and thought-provoking ways" <a href="#Kassabian"> [19].</a> Through their music, they convey the idea that "mixed identities" are beautiful in their own ways, and give the impression that being Armenian isn't strictly about Armenia nor is it about being "pure". It provided a way especially for newer generations to disconnect from hatred and enjoy musical beauty for what it is. Armenia and Armenianness has a place around the world and can even be important to those that aren't Armenian.


United States - California
================

<p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 30px; float: right; display: block;"><img src="SOAD.jpg" width="360" height="200" /><br /><span>From left to right: Serj, Shavo, Daron, John <br /> Clemente Ruiz/Press </span></p>

Formed in Glendale in 1994, System of a Down is a heavy metal band consisting of four Armenian-Americans that weave Armenian influences into their original works. Through their music, Serj, Daron, Shavo, and John would go on to raise awareness on the neglected recognition and lack of justice regarding the Armenian Genocide, both in straight forward and hidden ways.

One of the most direct examples is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgV6zVxRsIc"> "Holy Mountains" from *Hypnotize*</a>. This song features  chanting that somewhat serves as text painting, as they speak of the "haunting" presence of the souls that have passed. The main connection with Armenia and its music is through the lyrics, rather than the instrumentation or texture. It directly paints the idea of the Armenian Genocide and how Armenians were forced all the way across the Aras River, and associates the perpretrators as liars for their denial, killers for their actions, and demons for their celebration of the brutality. 

In terms of hidden music, there is a secret track in *Toxicity*. This track is a tsiranapogh rendition of the traditional Armenian church hymn Տէ՛ր ողորմեա ("Der Voghormia" - Lord Have Mercy) <a href="#SOAD">[20]</a>. This song is known as "Arto" in their discography, named after the Turkish-Armenian musician with whom they collaborated with: Arto Tunçboyacıyan (this Arto is the same one who played percussion for Night Ark!). 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNG7H0r2-SE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Der Voghormia was found within the works of Gomidas, who is said to have chanted it during the Armenian Genocide in an attempt to plead for the massacres to end. The original hymn is still used today as a closing to Armenian Church, a tradition that survived because of Gomidas. Although not partically fans of religion, SOAD understands how important it was to Armenian culture and still embraces it because it is representative of a large number of Armenians. Der Voghormia represents the resilience of the Armenians, as throughout history they have been persecuted for their Christianity but fought for what they believed in. It is a prayer for the fallen, and a request for peace on Earth. By presenting this song to a modern audience, SOAD opens the door to the history and culture behind it.

Their culturally-charged music doesn't end here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwyZ1gOhU_o"> "Jet Pilot"</a> from *Toxicity* speaks of carpet bombing attacks on Armenia. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxVzT0znI8Q">"P.L.U.C.K"</a> (<b>P</b>olitically <b>L</b>ying, <b>U</b>nholy, <b>C</b>owardly <b>K</b>illers) from their self-titled album was specifically dedicated to the victims of the Armenian Genocide, as stated in the album booklet <a href="#SOAD">[21]</a>. In 2020, SOAD came back from a hiatus to release <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_74nVpLVn9Q">"Genocidal Humanoidz"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqmknZNg1yw">"Protect The Land"</a>  in support of the Armenian region of Artsakh, which was being invaded.

Thanks to their incredible platform built through their unique style of music, System of a Down was crucial to making the world more familiar with Armenians, their culture, and the tragedies that they faced.

Closing
==============================================================

Despite bordering on extinction, the surviving Armenians were able to rebuild their lives and re-educate both themselves and future generations on what Armenian is through the creation, survival, and memories of music. The above musicians are only a small chapter in a large story of Armenian music, but it is thanks to their efforts that the Armenian Diaspora continues to have a unifying identity and unwavering understanding of their culture and origins.
