                          **Armenian Identity Through Music**


<p class='bigger'> ***Currently a work in progress - expected finish: May 2021*** </p>

Overview
==============================================================

From 1915 to 1917, the Armenian Genocide was the ethnic cleansing, cultural erasure, and expulsion of Armenians from their indigenous lands. This blog post describes, analyzes, and demonstrates how the Armenian diaspora around the world preserves its cultural identity through Armenian popular music. Through the use of written, aural, and visual resources, I will exhibit how the development of Armenian popular music since the 20th century functions as a connection to the homeland. First, an analysis of the works of 20th century Armenian composer and ethnomusicologist Gomidas will exemplify the marriage of the Western and Armenian music systems, as well as the composition, research, and preservation of Armenian music. This is followed by an examination of Armenian popular music in various places around the world, such as Armenia, Lebanon, Canada, and the coastal United States. These examinations will explore how the mixing and influence of Armenian music with the musical styles of different regions contribute to the Armenian identity. In order to establish a foundation which both Armenian music and identity have evolved from, these discussions will be supplemented by synopses on the Armenian music system, common Armenian instruments, and major events throughout Armenian history. 


I will be using the Western Armenian dialect for any translations.

Background
============================================================== 

<p class='bigger'> **Armenian Music System** </p>

<p><img src="musicalmodes.png" style="float:right;width:405px;height:250px;"></p>
Early Armenian chant music adhered to an 8-mode system known as *octoechos* (Armenian: ութ ձայն / oot tsayn - "eight voices"). This system has two different practices: liturgical and musical. The liturgical practice has the 8 modes evenly split into voice modes (first voice, second voice, etc.) and side modes (first side, second side, etc.). These divisions can be compared to the authentic and plagal divisions of Gregorian chant. The musical modes are also split up as such, but also has 4 further subdivisions: main mode, secondary modes, deviations, and ramifications. 

These subdivisions exist due to a specific subset of liturgical music known as *sharagan*, which made use of a tetrachordal system with non-Western intervals. Some of these intermediate intervals are major and minor semitones, subminor thirds, medium thirds, and pure major thirds. Taking some combination of three of these intervals forms a tetrachord species that fits into one of the octoechos subdivisions. For further details, especially with regard to the connection to the liturgical year, please check out the video by the Kerovpyan's referenced in the bibliography.

The <b>oud</b> is a short-necked lute that is played by plucking, usually with a plastic plectrum.

The <b>dhol</b> is a double-headed cylindrical drum with different membranes on each head. The membranes are typically made of goatskin or sheepskin. One membrane (thicker) creates a lower pitched sound, and the other membrane (thinner) creates a higher pitched sound.

Gomidas Vartabed
================
On October 8, 1869, Soghomon Soghomanian was born in Keotayha in the Ottoman Empire. From an early age, he received extensive religious education and was eventually ordained as a priest known as a *vartabed*. He then took on the pseudonym "Gomidas" after the 7th-century Armenian poet Gomidas Aghtsetsi, and became commonly known as Gomidas Vartabed.

<p class='bigger'> **System of a Down** </p>
Formed in Glendale in 1994, System of a Down is a heavy metal band consisting of four Armenian-Americans that weave Armenian influences into their original works. Through their music, Serj, Daron, Shavo, and John would go on to raise awareness on the neglected recognition and lack of justice regarding the Armenian Genocide, both in straight forward and hidden ways.

One of the most direct examples is "Holy Mountains" from *Hypnotize*. 

In terms of hidden music, there is a secret track in *Toxicity* that is played as a tag to one of their songs, "Aerials". This track is a tsiranapogh rendition of the traditional Armenian church hymn Տէ՛ր ողորմեա ("Der Voghormia" - Lord Have Mercy). This song is known as "Arto" in their discography, named after the Turkish-Armenian musician with whom they collaborated with: Arto Tunçboyacıyan. The song also prominently features **shouting/chanting I'm not sure what to call this**. The original piece is composed by Gomidas, who is said to have chanted it during the Armenian Genocide in an attempt to plead for the massacres to end.
