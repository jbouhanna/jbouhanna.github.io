                          **Armenian Identity Through Music**


<p class='bigger'> ***Currently a work in progress - expected finish: May 2021*** </p>

Overview
==============================================================

From 1915 to 1917, the Armenian Genocide served as an ethnic cleansing and expulsion of Armenians and their culture from their indigenous lands. This blog post describes, analyzes, and demonstrates how the Armenian diaspora nonetheless maintains its identity around the world through Armenian popular music. Through the use of written, aural, and visual resources, I will exhibit how the development of Armenian music since the 20th century functions as a connection to the homeland. First, an analysis of the works of 20th century Armenian composer and ethnomusicologist Gomidas will exemplify the marriage of the Western and Armenian music systems, as well as the research, composition, and preservation of Armenian music. This is followed by an examination of Armenian popular music in various places around the world such as Armenia, Lebanon, Canada, and the coastal United States, and how the mix between traditional Armenian music with different musical styles and music technology give a sense of home and identity. These discussions will be supplemented by synopses on common Armenian instruments, the Armenian music system, and major events in Armenian history, in order to establish a foundation from which both Armenian music and identity have evolved from. 

Background
============================================================== 

The focus of this blog is identity through Armenian music since the 20th century. Therefore, background discussion may be simplified and incomplete.

<p class='bigger'> **Armenian Music System** </p>

<p><img src="musicalmodes.png" style="float:right;width:405px;height:250px;"></p>
Early Armenian chant music adhered to an 8-mode system known as *octoechos* (Armenian: ութ ձայն / oot tsayn - "eight voices"). This system has two different practices: liturgical and musical. The liturgical practice has the 8 modes evenly split into voice modes (first voice, second voice, etc.) and side modes (first side, second side, etc.). These divisions can be compared to the authentic and plagal divisions of Gregorian chant. The musical modes are also split up as such, but also has 4 further subdivisions: main mode, secondary modes, deviations, and ramifications. 

These subdivisions exist due to a specific subset of liturgical music known as *sharagan*, which made use of a tetrachordal system with non-Western intervals. Some of these intermediate intervals are major and minor semitones, subminor thirds, medium thirds, and pure major thirds. Taking some combination of three of these intervals forms a tetrachord species that fits into one of the octoechos subdivisions. For further details, especially with regard to the connection to the liturgical year, please check out the video by the Kerovpyan's referenced in the bibliography.

The <b>oud</b> is a short-necked lute that is played by plucking, usually with a plastic plectrum. 
<br />It is made with lightweight wood, and is often pear-shaped. The sound holes are sometimes ornamented. There are typically 5 pairs of strings along with 1 bass string, making a total of 11 strings.

The <b>dhol</b> is a double-headed cylindrical drum with different membranes on each head. The membranes are typically made of goatskin or sheepskin. One membrane (thicker) creates a lower pitched sound, and the other membrane (thinner) creates a higher pitched sound.
