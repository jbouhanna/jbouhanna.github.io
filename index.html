                          **Armenian Identity Through Music**




Overview
==============================================================

This is a blog post that analyzes, demonstrates, and describes how the Armenian Diaspora finds its identity through Armenian popular music around the world. Through the use of written, aural, and visual resources, this page walks through the background, techniques, and development of Armenian music that covers the 20th and 21st centuries. There are two major topics, the first being the major works of Gomidas in the early 1900s, and the second being the development of Armenian popular music in various places around the world. These main ideas will be supplemented by brief discussions regarding the Armenian music system and instruments, the role of music in Armenian society, the Armenian Genocide, the annexation of Armenia by the USSR, and the Lebanese Civil War. This discussion spanning over 100 years of music development will demonstrate how Armenian popular music evolved and contributed to the Armenian identity throughout history.


Background
============================================================== 

The focus of this blog is identity through Armenian music since the 20th century. Therefore, background discussion may be simplified and incomplete.

**Armenian Music System**

<p><img src="musicalmodes.png" style="float:right;width:405px;height:250px;"></p>
Early Armenian chant music adhered to an 8-mode system known as *octoechos* (Armenian: ութ ձայն - literally "eight voices"). This system has two different practices: liturgical and musical. The liturgical practice has the 8 modes evenly split into voice modes (first voice, second voice, etc.) and side modes (first side, second side, etc.). These divisions can be compared to the authentic and plagal divisions of Gregorian chant. The musical modes are also split up as such, but also has 4 further subdivisions: main mode, secondary modes, deviations, and ramifications. 

These subdivisions exist due to a specific subset of liturgical music known as *sharagan*, which made use of a tetrachordal system with non-Western intervals. Some of these intermediate intervals are major and minor semitones, subminor thirds, medium thirds, and pure major thirds. Taking some combination of three of these intervals forms a tetrachord species that fits into one of the octoechos subdivisions. For further details, especially with regard to the connection to the liturgical year, please check out the video by the Kerovpyan's referenced in the bibliography.


**Traditional Instruments**
