                          **Armenian Identity Through Music**

Overview
==============================================================

From 1915 to 1923, the Armenian Genocide was the ethnic cleansing, cultural erasure, and expulsion of Armenians from their indigenous lands. This blog post describes, analyzes, and demonstrates how the Armenian diaspora around the world preserves its cultural identity through Armenian popular music. Through the use of written, aural, and visual resources, I will exhibit how the development of Armenian popular music since the 20th century functions as a connection to the homeland. First, an analysis of the works of 20th century Armenian composer and ethnomusicologist Gomidas will exemplify the marriage of the Western and Armenian music systems, as well as the composition, research, and preservation of Armenian music. This is followed by an examination of Armenian popular music in various places around the world, such as Armenia, Lebanon, Canada, and the coastal United States. These examinations will explore how the mixing and influence of Armenian music with the musical styles of different regions contribute to the Armenian identity. In order to establish a foundation which both Armenian music and identity have evolved from, these discussions will be supplemented by synopses on the Armenian music system, common Armenian instruments, and major events throughout Armenian history. 


I will be using the Western Armenian dialect for any translations.

Background
============================================================== 
<p class='bigger'> **Armenian Identity** </p>

What is Armenian Identity? Surely a specific answer exists, but I would argue that a specific answer is a wrong answer. I would believe that for any culture, what gives something a cultural identity isn't something as rigid as the composer being related to said culture, or being created in a specific place. I agree with the argument brought up by Tchilingirian, where it is the intent, thought, and message behind a cultural creation that establishes that connection <a href="#Tchilingirian"> [1].</a> This allows it to be flexible should it change over time, and allows for those who feel disconnected to their culture to become a part of it.


<p class='bigger'> **Armenian Music System** </p>

<p><img src="musicalmodes.png" style="float:right;width:405px;height:250px;"></p>
Early Armenian chant music adhered to an 8-mode system known as *octoechos* (Armenian: ութ ձայն / oot tsayn - "eight voices") <a href="#Kerovpyan"> [2] </a>. This system has two different practices: liturgical and musical. The liturgical practice has the 8 modes evenly split into voice modes (first voice, second voice, etc.) and side modes (first side, second side, etc.). These divisions can be compared to the authentic and plagal divisions of Gregorian chant. The musical modes are also split up as such, but also has 4 further subdivisions: main mode, secondary modes, deviations, and ramifications. 

These subdivisions exist due to a specific subset of liturgical music known as *sharagan*, which made use of a tetrachordal system with non-Western intervals. Some of these intermediate intervals are major and minor semitones, subminor thirds, medium thirds, and pure major thirds. Taking some combination of three of these intervals forms a tetrachord species that fits into one of the octoechos subdivisions. For further details, especially with regard to the connection to the liturgical year, please check out the <a href="#Kerovpyan"> video by the Kerovpyans referenced in the bibliography. </a>

<p class='bigger'> **Traditional Instruments** </p>

Although these instruments are common in Armenian music, they are not exclusive.<br /> Many countries in the Middle East and Caucasus make use of these instruments in their music <a href="#Instruments"> [3].</a>

<p><img src="oud.jpg" style="float:right;width:324px;height:200px;"></p>
The <b>oud</b> is a short-necked lute that is played by plucking, usually with a plastic plectrum. 
<br />It is made with lightweight wood, and is often pear-shaped. The sound holes are sometimes ornamented. There are typically 5 pairs of strings along with 1 bass string, making a total of 11 strings.

Gomidas Vartabed
================

<p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 30px; float: right; display: block;"><img src="Gomidas.jpg" width="300" height="400" /><br /><span>Gomidas at work <br /> http://www.komitas.am/eng/gallery/photos/photos1.htm</span></p>

On October 8, 1869, Soghomon Soghomanian was born in Keotayha in the Ottoman Empire. From an early age, he received extensive religious education and was eventually ordained as a priest known as a *vartabed*. He then took on the pseudonym "Gomidas" after the 7th-century Armenian poet Gomidas Aghtsetsi, and became commonly known as Gomidas Vartabed<a href="#Vagramian"> [4].</a> 

Composing, arranging, and transcribing over 3,000 works of folk music, Gomidas's works received praise from local communities and abroad. Later in his musical career, Gomidas had received a three-year scholarship to study music in Berlin. He accepted it, and went on to study music history and the works of Beethoven and Mozart. In addition, he visited many of the symphonic and choral concerts, as well as operas. It was here that Gomidas established the marriage between western music and Armenian music - he continued to compose and arrange while in Berlin, while also entertaining professional journals with his insight on eastern music. These insights were not only on the origins and meanings behind Armenian music, but also the Arabic, Kurdish, Turkish, and Persian melodies that he studied as part of his ethnomusicological career.

Gomidas later ended up at the Paris Conservatory, where he brought his Armenian influnces and phonetics to the interested French singers. Successfully coaching these students into renowned concert performances, he was often compared to Bartok, and Debussy himself remarked that even if "Andouni" ("Homeless") was the only song ever composed by Gomidas, he should still be considered to be one of the musical greats <a href="#Tchilingirian"> [5]. </a>

What is so special about "Andouni"? Let's take a look! Give a listen to this performance by Isabel Bayrakdarian (English translation included in the video).

Below is my transcription of the melody, and a general placement of the English lyrics:
						picturepicturepicturepicturepicture

The lyrics generalize the despair and helplessness felt by Armenians in an artistic fashion. The end of each stanza has drawn-out notes, sighs, and tense  exclamations that draws emotional appeal and contributes to the dramatic intensity. The slow tempo gives this sense of a motionless state - life goes on, but the soul is trapped in an inner struggle. There is a lot of vocal emptiness between lines, giving the idea the mind is slow to think as it wallows in misery. There is no comfort left in the world, so "let me be food for the fish" instead. It is important to note Gomidas arranged "Andouni" before the 1915 events.* However, his mastery of music enabled the song to resonate the somber and despair that the victims have felt.

*The Armenian Genocide inflicted Gomidas with a mental trauma that he never recovered from, and died in a psychiatric clinic in 1935. It is unclear, but very unlikely that he was able to continue working with music.


Armenia
================

Lebanon
================
A local safe haven for genocide survivors, Lebanon became known as the de facto capital of the Armenian diaspora due to welcoming a large influx of refugees <a href="Alajaji2">[6]</a>. Here, Armenians worked to rebuild their lives and stay connected with each other. One way to do this was through music, of course. After facing near extinction from the genocide, one critical matter to the diaspora was the notion of language. The scattering of Armenians around the world, as well as lack of Armenian education in these various places, have caused the Armenian language to become forgotten in bits and pieces to many families. Many Armenians were familiar with the Turkish and Arabic languages due to living in the Ottoman Empire and nearby Arab countries, which lessened the use of Armenian. 

Slowly but surely, the diaspora caught on to this and began pushing for more use of the Armenian language. For example, church bulletins and graffiti appeared in Armenian neighborhoods insisting that Armenian be spoken <a href="Alajaji2">[7]</a>. Church hymns were sung in Armenian, and many composed songs by Armenians had lyrics purely in Armenian. Hymns written in other languages were converted to Armenian, both in writing and singing. The Lebanese-Armenian community is unique in that in a region outside of Armenia, the Armenian language flourished and revitalized. Language was seen as the key cultural marker of Armenian identity, and the diaspora kept the idea of "to be Armenian, you must speak Armenian." 

A large contributor to the lingual push in church music was Gomidas himself. Although he spent his final years in Paris, he left behind a mantle that would be taken up by Armenian choirs. The choirs sang, harmonized, and taught his songs to schools and orphanages all throughout Lebanon. These choirs would tour the Middle East and Europe, similarly to how Gomidas' choirs did. The content of this music helped strengthen the idea of "Armenianness". They would sing of the Armenian mountain Ararat, historical events, and important heroes in Armenian history. The performances of choirs worked three-fold: revitalize the Armenian language, teach the listeners of important aspects of Armenian heritage and history, and tie the once-broken community together. The immense popularity of these choirs caused them to become the musical focal point for Armenians in Lebanon <a href="Alajaji2">[8]</a>.

In terms of nationalistic music, the Armenian national anthem "Մեր Հայրենիք" ("Mer Hayrenik" - Our Fatherland) was composed by Parsegh Ganatchian, a spiritual child to Gomidas. 

As odd as it may seem that the Armenian national anthem is in the Lebanon section, Ganatchian was a Lebanese-Armenian, and it was the efforts of the Armenian community in Lebanon that led to its creation.

The main inspiration for the music came from the diatonic, tetrachordal music that was commonly found in hymns and Gomidas' music. The lyrics were written by Mikayel Nalbandian, and together the music and words give off a sense of pride and love for Armenia. 


Canada
================

United States - New York
================

<p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 30px; float: right; display: block;"><img src="maid.jpg" width="320" height="400" /><br /><span>Armenian Maid, a 1919 song that served to fundraise Armenian relief <br /> https://arabkitsch.com/song-directory-2/239/armenian-maid/ </span></p>

New York - the jazz capital of America. Jazz has popularly fused with many other genres, and this includes Armenian music. Armenians contributed a lot to the music scene on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan by performing in the nightclubs and restaurants. This attracted not only Armenians, but also the variety of other people in the area. Popular performers included Mary Vartanian, Marko Melkon, and Garbis Bakirgian (who later moved to California) <a href="#Alajaji2">[6].</a> Music served as a way to share culture and to raise awareness regarding the on-going genocide. 

Most notably, the quartet known as Night Ark helped spotlight Armenian music in the jazz world. Featuring the oud, piano, percussion, and bass, Night Ark mixed Armenian music with jazz, classical, pop, and rock music to create a blend of jazz with an eastern feel <a href="#Kassabian">[7].</a>

As a diaspora, Armenians struggle with establishing their presence, political recognition, intermarriage, and declining growth in fluent speakers. Armenians sometimes feel very nationalistic as a result, to fight against this mixing and loss of culture, as seen in the Lebanon section. However, Armenian fusion groups such as Night Ark twist that negative idea into a benefit - "they use diasporan  culture  to  reflect  and  support,  produce  and  project  their  mixed  identities in thoughtful and thought-provoking ways" <a href="#Kassabian"> [8].</a> Through their music, they convey the idea that "mixed identities" are beautiful in their own ways, and give the impression that being Armenian isn't strictly about Armenia. Instead, Armenia and Armenianness has a place around the world and can be important to those that aren't Armenian.

One of their most popular pieces is "Homecoming", which is an instrumental track that makes use of both eastern and western musical elements. The prominence of an oud playing on top of a tresillo pattern on a marimba all while a hi-hat emphasizes the offbeats pulls the ear to noticing a stylistic contrast that works together in harmony.

Other songs such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU5F5xS1lCg"> "They Love Me 15 Feet Away"</a> incorporates vocals, and has a more upbeat tempo and rhythm, giving off a pop feel to the music. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2ikBp1OLfc"> "Very Nice"</a> is more of a smooth jazz piece, and is mainly a duet between the oud and piano.


United States - California
================

<p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 30px; float: right; display: block;"><img src="SOAD.jpg" width="360" height="200" /><br /><span>From left to right: Serj, Shavo, Daron, John <br /> Clemente Ruiz/Press </span></p>

Formed in Glendale in 1994, System of a Down is a heavy metal band consisting of four Armenian-Americans that weave Armenian influences into their original works. Through their music, Serj, Daron, Shavo, and John would go on to raise awareness on the neglected recognition and lack of justice regarding the Armenian Genocide, both in straight forward and hidden ways.

One of the most direct examples is "Holy Mountains" from *Hypnotize*. This song features  chanting that somewhat serves as text painting, as they speak of the "haunting" presence of the souls that have passed. The main connection with Armenia and its music is through the lyrics, rather than the instrumentation or texture. It directly paints the idea of the Armenian Genocide and how Armenians were forced all the way across the Aras River, and associates the perpretrators as liars for their denial, killers for their actions, and demons for their celebration of the brutality. 

<iframe width="200" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WgV6zVxRsIc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

In terms of hidden music, there is a secret track in *Toxicity*. This track is a tsiranapogh rendition of the traditional Armenian church hymn Տէ՛ր ողորմեա ("Der Voghormia" - Lord Have Mercy). This song is known as "Arto" in their discography, named after the Turkish-Armenian musician with whom they collaborated with: Arto Tunçboyacıyan (this Arto is the same one who played percussion for Night Ark!). Der Voghormia was found within the works of Gomidas, who is said to have chanted it during the Armenian Genocide in an attempt to plead for the massacres to end.

<iframe width="550" height="309" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNG7H0r2-SE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

Their culturally-charged music doesn't end here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwyZ1gOhU_o"> "Jet Pilot"</a> from *Toxicity* speaks of carpet bombing attacks on Armenia. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxVzT0znI8Q">"P.L.U.C.K"</a> (<b>P</b>olitically <b>L</b>ying, <b>U</b>nholy, <b>C</b>owardly <b>K</b>illers) from their self-titled album was specifically dedicated to the victims of the Armenian Genocide, as stated in the album booklet. In 2020, SOAD came back from a hiatus to release <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_74nVpLVn9Q">"Genocidal Humanoidz"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqmknZNg1yw">"Protect The Land"</a>  in support of the Armenian region of Artsakh, which was being invaded.

Thanks to their incredible platform built through their unique style of music, System of a Down was crucial to making the world more familiar with Armenians, their culture, and the tragedies that they faced.
